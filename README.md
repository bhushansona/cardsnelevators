Some guidelines before running solutions:
1. The solution is written in VS 2017 and .Net core. You can change frameworkÂ if needed.
2. For card deck problem, you will need change output text file pact as per your convenience.
3. For elevator solution, you need to wait till 2 minutes as it contains delays to simulate elevator actions.
4. Both solutions are developed in single project (console). So you will need to change start up project to execute one at a time.
